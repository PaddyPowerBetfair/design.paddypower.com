#### About Toast Notification

A toast is a container that displays feedback to the user.

The toast appears sliding from the bottom and fixed in the same position on top of any other contents. It can be configured to be dismissed in 3 different ways:

1. manually by taping the close button.
2. automatically after X seconds.
3. automatically after a predefined action.
